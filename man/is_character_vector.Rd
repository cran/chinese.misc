\title{A Convenient Version of is.character}
\usage{
is_character_vector(x, len = NULL, allow_all_na = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object to be checked}

\item{len}{numeric vector represents the permitted length of character vector. If an 
object is a character vector, but its length is not in \code{len}, the function 
still returns \code{FALSE}. The default is \code{NULL},
which means any length is OK.}

\item{allow_all_na}{for length>1 character vector whose elements are 
all \code{NA}, if this argument is \code{FALSE}, then the function returns \code{FALSE}, 
if this argument is \code{TRUE} (default), then returns \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}.
}
\description{
This function checks to see if the object is a character vector. It is designed to have different
actions from \code{\link{is.character}} and thus sometimes more convenient. See Details.
}
\details{
Sometimes we want to check if an object is a character vector. But \code{is.character} cannot
do this, because it also returns \code{TRUE} for a character matrix or data frame.
What's more, we usually not only want to see if an object is of class 
character, but also want to see 
if it is valid, that is, can be passed to other functions without errors. But \code{is.character} 
even returns \code{TRUE} for \code{character(0)}. 
Also, \code{is.character(NA)} returns \code{FALSE}, but 
\code{is.character(as.character(NA))} returns \code{TRUE}, but in fact there is really 
no difference between the two for users and many functions that do not allow \code{NA}.

We list below the returns of \code{is.character2}: 

\itemize{
  \item (1) if the object is \code{NULL}, \code{is.character2} returns \code{FALSE}. 
  \item (2) if the object is of length 0, it always returns \code{FALSE}. 
  \item (3) if the object is not vector, \code{FALSE}. 
  \item (4) if it has only one element and this element is \code{NA}, under all circumstances it 
returns \code{FALSE}. 
  \item (5) if the vector is of length>1, all the elements are \code{NA}, 
but the vector's class is not character, it returns \code{FALSE}. 
  \item (6) if a character vector is of length>1, and all the elements
are \code{NA}, then the result depends on argument \code{allow_all_na}, if 
\code{allow_all_na = TRUE}, then \code{TRUE}, otherwise, \code{FALSE}.
